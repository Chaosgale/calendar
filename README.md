# Daily Planner

## Description
Welcome to the Daily Planner application! This planner is designed to help you create and organize your daily schedule efficiently. Here's a guide to getting started:

## Features 
### Current Day Display:

When you open the planner, the current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar. This ensures you're always aware of the current date as you plan your day.

### Timeblock View:

As you scroll down the page, you'll encounter timeblocks representing standard business hours from 9am to 5pm. Each timeblock is visually distinguished and ready for scheduling.

### Color-Coded Timeblocks:

Timeblocks are color-coded to indicate whether they represent past, present, or future times. This feature provides visual cues to help you quickly identify the timing of your tasks.

### Event Scheduling:

Clicking into a timeblock allows you to enter events or tasks for that specific time slot. Simply click on the desired timeblock and input your event details.

### Save Events to Local Storage:

After entering an event, clicking the save button for that timeblock ensures that the event's text is saved locally. This functionality allows you to persistently store your schedule even after refreshing the page.

### Persistence Across Page Refresh:

Upon refreshing the page, your saved events persist, ensuring that you don't lose any of your scheduled tasks. This feature provides convenience and reliability in managing your daily agenda.
